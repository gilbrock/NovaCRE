# How to View NovaCRE Outside of Claude

## Step 1: Download the Files

You need to download these 2 files to your computer:
1. **novacre.html** - The main application
2. **skyline.mp4** - The background video

To download:
- Click on each file link in Claude
- Right-click on the page and select "Save As" or use your browser's download feature
- Save both files to the SAME FOLDER on your computer (e.g., Desktop/NovaCRE/)

## Step 2: Download Additional Files (Optional but Recommended)

For the app to work with your existing data, also download:
- **candidates.csv** - Your candidate data
- All the **.jpg files** - Candidate photos

Place ALL files in the same folder together.

## Step 3: Open the Application

1. Open your file explorer (Finder on Mac, File Explorer on Windows)
2. Navigate to the folder where you saved the files
3. Double-click on **novacre.html**
4. The app will open in your default web browser

## What You Should See

✅ Splash screen with moving cityscape video in the background
✅ "novaCRE" logo with tagline
✅ Three navigation buttons (View Candidates, Search, Compare)
✅ Data management options at the bottom

## Troubleshooting

**If the video doesn't play:**
- Make sure skyline.mp4 is in the same folder as novacre.html
- Try opening in a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- The video should autoplay - if your browser blocks autoplay, you may need to enable it

**If you don't see your candidate data:**
- First time: Upload your CSV and photos using the buttons at the bottom
- The data will be saved automatically in your browser
- Next time you open the app, your data will be there

**Browser Compatibility:**
- Best: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions)
- All modern browsers support the features in this app

## File Structure

Your folder should look like this:
```
NovaCRE/
├── novacre.html (REQUIRED)
├── skyline.mp4 (REQUIRED for video background)
├── candidates.csv (optional - can upload later)
├── README.md (optional - documentation)
└── [candidate photos].jpg (optional - can upload later)
```

## Using the App

Once opened in your browser:
1. If first time: Upload CSV and photos from splash screen footer
2. Click "View Candidates" to see your candidate list
3. Use filters to narrow down candidates
4. Check boxes to select candidates for comparison
5. Click "Compare Selected" to view side-by-side
6. Click any candidate card to see full details

Your data is automatically saved in your browser's localStorage, so you won't need to re-upload every time!

## Privacy Note

All data stays on your computer in your browser. Nothing is sent to any servers. Your candidate information is completely private and secure.
